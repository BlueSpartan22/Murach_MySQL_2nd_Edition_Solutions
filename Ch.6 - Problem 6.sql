What is the total amount invoiced for each general ledger account number? 
Return these columns: The account number from the Invoice_Line_Items table The sum of the line item amounts from the Invoice_Line_Items table 
Use the WITH ROLLUP operator to include a row that gives the grand total. 
This should return 22 rows.

Execute Current Statement button to execute this statement.
