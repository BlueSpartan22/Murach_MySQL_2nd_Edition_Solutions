SELECT DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%m-%d-%Y') AS 'current_date';

/*
Write a SELECT statement without a FROM clause that uses the CURRENT_DATE function to return the current date in its default format. 
Use the DATE_FORMAT function to format the current date in this format: mm-dd-yyyy 
(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_date-format) 
This displays the month, day, and four‚Äêdigit year of the current date. Give this column an alias of current_date. 
To do that, you must enclose the alias in quotes since that name is already used by the CURRENT_DATE function.
